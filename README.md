# Python Data Structures and Algorithms Toolkit

This repo is a toolkit and personal reference for data structure and algorithms in Python3.

- Libraries are summarized into an accessible subset of the official docs as a usable reference for 90%+ of data structure and algorithm questions.

- Data structure implementations are added.

- Patterns for common problem types are in progress.

- Links and resources are available.

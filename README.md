# Python Data Structures and Algorithms Reference

This repo is a Python3 toolkit and personal reference for data structure and algorithms. Libraries such as 'functools', 'collections', 'regex', and 'itertools' are included, as well as commonly used built-in methods.

- The 'collections' library, provides a set of collection classes, including defaultdict, deque, ChainMap, Counter, OrderedDict, and more, which can be leveraged to optimize performance and memory efficiency.

- The 'functools' library offers an array of higher-order functions and operations on callable objects, allowing for functional programming solutions.

- The 'heapq' library contains data structures and methods useful for creating and using a heap.

- The 'itertools' library provides a set of optimized, memory-efficient tools for working with iterators, ideally for working with problems containing large data sets.

- The 'regex' library offers a set of regular expression operations, useful for pattern matching and text processing.

- The 'string' library contains useful functions for questions involving strings and characters.

- Finally, the repo offers an overview of built-in data structures and algorithms in Python, such as lists, sets, dictionaries, and more, which can be used to solve a wide range of problems.
